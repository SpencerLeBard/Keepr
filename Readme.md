# Requirements

### Monday:

- View Count - server side in repo/setActiveId
- ActiveKeep is not hitting server

### Tuesday:

- Add `keep`to `vault`
- Delete `keeps` from `vault`s
- vault page/details
- routes for vault page
- in vault page if user is creator they can remove keep from vault

### Wednesday

- profile page adheres to mock:
- public/private vaults - request fails if private
- Keeps created by that user
- Total `keep`s count
- Anytime a `keep` is `kept in a vault` the keep count is incremented
- Total public `vault`s count
- Users can only Delete things they created

### Pretty much done:

- All deletes require confirmation

X - All API Tests pass
